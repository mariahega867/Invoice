My father is a business owner who does not know much Enlgish. He does not know how to create an invoice due to this. I created this program that will automatically create an invoice for him, by inputting:
1)Client's Name
2)Clients's Address  
3) Item Description
4)Quantity  
5)Price Per Item

The program will the calculate the total and in the inovice it will display his email and contact information. This will stored as a PDF that can then be sent as email to his clients.
